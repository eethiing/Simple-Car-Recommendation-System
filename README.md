# Simple-Car-Recommendation-System

## Solution Description
----------------------
The user has to select the options available in the drop-down list for each field before the system will recommend a car model. The drop-down options for integer fields such as price range, horsepower, manufactured year, and mileage are all in a form of range whereas if the fields are strings, it will show the available options.

If there is a suitable model found after searching through the database (excel sheet), the system will display the recommended car model  and the user has the option to either close the window or show more details related to the car model.
